# KangCompiler

This repository contains HeeChan Kang's (kang@augsburg.edu) compiler for CSC 451. This code should eventually be able to take in a pascal code and convert it to MIPS code.

The Scanner has been created using the JFlex tool - and as intended, 3foo returns a NUM token and a ID token, instead of an ILLEGAL token.


The code is for educational purposes only.
